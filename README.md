# Vehicle-Route-Optimization
• Developed an optimization solution for the Vehicle Routing Problem using genetic algorithms
• Crafted a fitness evaluation function for VRP and made use of eaSimple algorithm to solve the standard logistics problem in both production and distribution businesses
• Utilized the DEAP library for evolutionary computation. Employed Matplotlib for visualizing complex routing solutions
